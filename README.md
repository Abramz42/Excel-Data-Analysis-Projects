## **1. Comprehensive World Population Analysis: A Dashboard Approach**

**Project Goal:**
The primary goal of this project was to analyze global population data over time to uncover trends and insights across different continents and countries, while creating an interactive and visually engaging dashboard for easy interpretation and decision-making. Specifically, the project aimed to:

1. **Clean the Data:** Address and rectify duplicate entries, incorrect data points, and null values to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. **Create a Dashboard Highlighting:**
   - The top 10 countries for each continent based on population.
   - The growth trends of continents and individual countries over the years.

**Solutions:**
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Initiated by cleaning the dataset, handling duplicates, correcting inaccuracies, and managing null values to ensure the data's integrity.
  
2. **Pivot Tables and Charts:** Summarized and visualized key population trends across different continents and countries over various years using Excel's pivot tables and charts.

3. **Dashboard Creation:** Developed a user-friendly dashboard to present the analysis. The dashboard includes interactive filters for continents and countries, visualizing population growth, top 10 countries per continent, average density, and percentage distribution across continents.

**Additionally,** extra insights were added to the dashboard, such as:

- The **average population density** for each continent.
- The **percentage breakdown** of the global population by continent, with a specific focus on individual countries when filters are applied.

**Impact:**
This project provided a detailed and easily understandable visualization of world population trends, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions based on historical and current population data. The interactive dashboard allows for quick insights and comparisons across different regions and time periods, making it a valuable tool for demographic analysis and strategic planning.

## **2. Thyroid Cancer Data Analysis and Insights Dashboard**

**Project Goal:**  
The goal of the project was to:
1. Clean the thyroid cancer dataset by removing null, duplicate, and incorrect values.
2. Use pivot tables and charts to analyze the data and create a comprehensive dashboard highlighting:
   - Age distribution across cases.
   - Gender distribution among the diagnosed patients.
   - Stage count of thyroid cancer cases.

**Solution:**  
The analysis was performed in three stages:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Dealt with missing, duplicate, and erroneous values to ensure the dataset's accuracy and reliability.
2. **Data Analysis:** Employed pivot tables and charts to gain insights into various factors such as age, gender, cancer stages, and recurrence count.
3. **Dashboard Creation:** Built an interactive dashboard displaying key metrics, including age and gender distributions, recurrence rates, and cancer stage breakdowns. Additionally, interactive filters were incorporated, allowing users to filter the data by specific factors like smoking habits, history of radiotherapy, focality, and risk level.

**Impact:**  
This thyroid cancer analysis dashboard serves as a powerful tool for healthcare professionals and researchers by offering a clear and interactive view of crucial factors such as age, gender, and cancer stage distribution. The filters provide flexibility in exploring specific demographics and risk factors, leading to more targeted insights. These insights can support more personalized treatment strategies and help identify patterns in recurrence rates, ultimately improving medical decision-making for thyroid cancer patients.

## **3. Salary Trends Analysis in Computer Professions**

**Goal:**  
The objective of the project was to:
1. Clean the salary dataset by handling duplicates, null values, and incorrect data points.
2. Utilize pivot tables and charts to create a comprehensive dashboard showcasing:
   - Salary distributions based on job levels (entry, mid, senior, and executive).
   - Different job types (freelance, contract, part-time, full-time) and their counts.
   - The number of on-site, hybrid, and remote jobs over the years.
   - Average salary insights based on job titles and company size.

**Solution:**  
The solution was developed through the following stages:
1. **Data Cleaning:** The salary dataset was cleaned by removing null and duplicate values, ensuring data consistency for analysis.
2. **Data Analysis:** Pivot tables and visualizations were created to analyze salary patterns across various job roles, experience levels, and company sizes.
3. **Dashboard Creation:** A comprehensive, interactive dashboard was created, displaying:
   - Average salary by job levels, showing that executive and senior roles have the highest salaries.
   - A comparison of salary by job titles, such as data engineers, data scientists, and software engineers.
   - A detailed breakdown of job counts, including full-time, part-time, freelance, and contract jobs.
   - Job count based on working environmentsâ€”on-site, remote, and hybrid.
   - Distribution of job counts across different company sizes (small, medium, large).

**Impact:**  
This salary analysis dashboard offers valuable insights into compensation trends in the computer professions sector. Employers can use it to set competitive salaries, while job seekers can gain insights into potential earnings based on their experience, job role, and preferred working conditions. Additionally, the dashboard allows stakeholders to explore how company size affects salary and job availability.

## **4. Obesity Data Analytics Overview**

**Goal:**  
The primary goal of the project was to:
1. Clean the obesity dataset by removing duplicate, missing, and erroneous data points.
2. Utilize pivot tables and charts to create a dashboard that provides insights into:
   - The distribution of obesity in the surveyed population.
   - Gender distribution in relation to obesity.
   - Family history of obesity, smoking habits, and transportation modes of the participants.

**Solution:**  
The project was executed in three stages:
1. **Data Cleaning:** The dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy by handling duplicates and null values, which set a strong foundation for analysis.
2. **Data Analysis:** Key insights were drawn from the dataset using pivot tables and charts to visualize patterns and distributions. This included factors like obesity rates, smoking habits, family history, and transportation modes.
3. **Dashboard Creation:** A user-friendly, interactive dashboard was created to visualize the key metrics, including:
   - Obesity distribution and the sex count of the participants.
   - Family history count (whether participants had a family history of obesity).
   - Smoking count and SCC (smoking cessation) count.
   - The transportation modes used, such as public transport, walking, automobiles, etc.

**Impact:**  
This obesity analytics dashboard helps policymakers, researchers, and healthcare professionals understand obesity patterns and correlations within various lifestyle factors, such as smoking and transportation modes.
